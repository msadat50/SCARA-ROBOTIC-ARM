# SCARA-ROBOTIC-ARM
A scara robotic arm is a arm that can do many different things such as drawing, playing game and lots of other fun things. We're creating a robotic arm that will write out letters. We wanted this because we wanted to try something challenging and different that we have never thought of making. Made by Mariam and Malachi

### The final project pricture 
This is the final look of scara robotic arm.


## Project_prep_questions

### What is the problem you are trying to solve?
How to control the robot movement/ giving them commands? 
How are we gonna work out the calculations? 

### What are the requirements for this assignment?

The requirements for this project are arduino, stepper motor, maybe a servo, pen, wires, drive motor, Acrylic Sheet, battery pack with batteries, and bolts and nuts.

2 stepper motors control each of the 2 arms, servo will control the height of the pen

### Proof_of_concept

### what is our Proof of concept? 
Getting the stepper motor to move

5v will be unplugged, 9v battery will be plugged into correlating positive and negative collumns on far side of breadboad, wires from motor controller in positive and negative slots will be plugged into correlating positive and negative lanes in the same column of where the battery is plugged in.

Before we start doing CAD this was our design, but as we started builting we realized a lot of problems and had to changed and added a lot to our design.   


At first we wanted to make our robot like this,but than ater we came up with a different design.

This is when I stated to prototyping, we wanted a really simple and easy design and so we came up with this.  
<img src="https://github.com/msadat50/SCARA-ROBOTIC-ARM/blob/main/Images/pictures/robotic%20assembly%20pic.PNG?raw=true" width="400">
<img src="https://github.com/msadat50/SCARA-ROBOTIC-ARM/blob/main/Images/pictures/The%20side%20wall.PNG?raw=true" width="400">
When we started doing the actual design we really liked the design of our prototype, so we kept the design. These 2 picture is when we started doing the design. Mr H helped me design the wall easier and faster. All we did was that we created a rectangle on the top wall and then extrude it downwards 93mm and we did the same thing to all of the walls. At the end all we added was a laser joint and a T-slot joint to make the walls connect to eachother. 
<img src="https://github.com/msadat50/SCARA-ROBOTIC-ARM/blob/main/Images/pictures/The%20real%20box.PNG?raw=true" width="400">
As time went on I realized that our design won't really work on how we want the robot to work, so I changed and added a lot of different things to our design. For example, if you look back at our design when we first started you will see that there is 2 motor but none of them will control the 2nd arm, so Mr H helped me came up with a solution where we put 2 motors on top of eachother using a motor support.

This is all of the material inside the box. Mr H helped me make a bracket for the buttery so that the buttery stay still.

This is a closer picture of the arm that shows how things are set and we added a caster ball to hold the weight of the arm.

This is the front wall and it that shows where the materials will be at.  
<img src="https://github.com/msadat50/SCARA-ROBOTIC-ARM/blob/main/Images/pictures/arm%202.PNG?raw=true" width="100"> 
This is the first arm. We had change this arm a lot at first it looked like the 2nd arm, but then later we added a D-shift and made it round shape.

This is the 2nd arm. 



## Description for code

This is the measurement of the stepper motor. 


## Final_Reflections

### Coding Reflection- Malachi 

### Cad Reflection- Mariam 
In the beginning, I think I underestimated how many different parts of the box needed to change and extruded because they need to hold other parts. Thinking through all of this was a lot. Each time when we were finished there was always a differnt problem to slove thank fully Mr. H helped me get through all of it. Each time when we were done we had to double check to see if there was other problem.
